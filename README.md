# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

* This project contains the implementation of several sorting algorithms using The C Programming Language __C__.

| Implemented Algorithms |
|:-|
|['Bubble sort'](./Bubble sort) |  repeatedly compare and swap adjacent elements until the list is sorted. |
|['Insertion sort'](./Insertion sort) |  build sorted list by inserting elements in correct position.. |

# General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
