# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

* This project contains the implementation of several sorting algorithms using The C Programming Language __C__.

| Implemented Algorithms |
|:-|
|['Bubble sort'](./Bubble sort) |  repeatedly compare and swap adjacent elements until the list is sorted. |
|['Insertion sort'](./Insertion sort) |  build sorted list by inserting elements in correct position. |
|['Selection sort'](./Selection sort) |   iteratively find and swap the smallest element to its correct position. |
|['Quick sort'](./Quick sort) |  recursively partition and sort elements. |
|['Shell sort'](./Shell sort) |  repeatedly sort subsets of elements using diminishing increment gaps.|
|['Cocktail shaker sort'](./Cocktail shaker sort) |  repeatedly sort elements in both directions, like a shaking motion. |
|['Counting sort'](./Counting sort) |  categorize and arrange elements based on their count. |
|['Merge sort'](./Merge sort) |  divide and conquer by recursively merging sorted subarrays. |
|['Heap sort'](./Heap sort) |  create a binary heap and repeatedly extract the maximum element to sort the array. |
|['Bitonic sort'](./Bitonic sort) |  recursively divide the array into bitonic sequences and then compare and swap elements to create a sorted sequence. |
|['Radix sort'](./Radix sort) |  sort elements based on individual digits or characters, starting from the least significant position and moving towards the most significant position. |

# General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
